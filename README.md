# Acknowledgements

## Giana
I would like to thank the original developer for creating an excellent script, initially for QBCore, that allows players to change their outfits at a vehicle. I attempted to maintain the full integrity of her code while still adding increased functionality and support for the Qbox Framework. All credit goes to Giana for her original code.

## QBCore
I would like to thank the developers of QBCore for creating a solid RP framework for FiveM servers that allows for easy development of scripts to enhance gameplay.

## Qbox
I would also like to thank the developers of Qbox for creating a solid, alternative RP framework for FiveM servers that allows for easy development of scripts to enhance gameplay.

## Overextended
I would like to thank the amazing developers at Overextended for creating a stellar resource in Ox Lib.

## Community Ox
I would like to thank the team at Community Ox for continuing on with Overextended's legacy by maintaining their resources for future use with Five M development.

## Lation
I would like to thank Lation for developing a clean and sophisticated UI interface for FiveM which I am proud to directly support in this resource.
